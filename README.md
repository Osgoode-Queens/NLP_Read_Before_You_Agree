 ## Objective
outlines the concept of a third-party extension (henceforth known as the Read Before You Agree, or ‘RBYA’) connected to conventional browsers (such as Google Chrome) to be used in tandem with a consumer signing up for any online-based product or service with an associated ToS agreement, similar to the user experience with add-ins such as the Honey extension.8  In addition, the RBYA may also be available as a web or app service where consumers can paste their ToS agreements which will help identify punitive and digital privacy clauses that warrant their attention. 



RBYA is envisioned to add value to consumers in three potential ways: 

    Level 1: RBYA identifies specific clauses in ToS agreements that have to do with collection and / or use of personal data or are punitive in nature and directs the consumer to pay attention to those clauses. This will be accomplished with NLP learning algorithms that are trained on a large sample of ToS agreements. 

    Level 2: RBYA uses natural language processing (‘NLP’) to “translate” or summarize the clauses identified in Level 1 from legalese into layman’s language, such that it becomes easily understandable by the consumer, and such that the consumer becomes aware of exactly what personal data they are being required to give up 

    Level 3: RBYA could recommend alternative products or services that may have less punitive data requirements but may deliver the same utility to consumers. 

These initial features were put through the design thinking process and this proposal intends to show the evolution of the minimum viable product.
