# NLP_Read_Before_You_Agree

 ## Objective:

 This project outlines the concept of a third-party extension (henceforth known as the Read Before You Agree, or ‘RBYA’) connected to conventional browsers (such as Google Chrome) to be used in tandem with a consumer signing up for any online-based product or service with an associated ToS agreement, similar to the user experience with add-ins such as the [Honey extension](https://www.joinhoney.com/).  In addition, the RBYA may also be available as a web or app service where consumers can paste their ToS agreements which will help identify punitive and digital privacy clauses that warrant their attention.
